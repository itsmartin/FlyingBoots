FlyingBoots
===========

A simple plugin that provides one function: when a player is wearing gold boots, they will be able to fly.

By default, the plugin is disabled when loaded. To enable it, a player with the ```flyingboots.toggle``` permission 
needs to run the ```/flyingboots``` command.

While FlyingBoots is active, any player who puts on a pair of gold boots will be given the ability to fly, and
any player not wearing gold boots will fall.

Players in creative mode are unaffected. If FlyingBoots is disabled, any non-creative players currently flying will
fall to the ground, and then the plugin will stop checking anything (so that it does not interfere with other plugins).
